    "paragraph": "Hi, my name is Jonathan Serbent, and I built this website so I could have a place to share things about myself. An interesting thing you might not know about me is that I lived in Shanghai for 12 years. In that time I met tons of amazing people, and did loads of incredible things like form a band, perform in front of hundreds of people, go on awesome trips, learn about game development and make my own games, and much more. You can learn more about some of the things I've done by clicking the tabs above, or by scrolling down and clicking one of the links below. If you don't know where to start, click the About me tab at the top."
