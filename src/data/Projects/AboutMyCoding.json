    "content":"I started coding for the first time in the 6th grade in python, then in summer camps I learned java for the first time. I took AP computer science in my junior year of high school, scoring a five on the AP Exam. In my free time I enjoyed working on projects and learning about coding. Currently I am majoring in computer science at the University of Texas at Austin, and I plan to graduate in May of 2022. I have taken many computer science classes here, including Data Structures, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Computer Algorithms, Object Oriented Programming, and Software Engineering. In have also worked as a software engineering intern at Waldo Photos in 2019, and PayPal in 2020."
