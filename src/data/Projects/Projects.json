            "description": "This project was for CS 314: Data Structures. In this project I had to use binary trees, and queues to do huffman encoding to compress files. The program would read a byte at a time, and count up the number of occurences of each byte in the file. The tally for each byte along with the type of byte would be placed into a priority queue. They would then be popped from the queue in order to make a binary tree. Traversing this tree would determine the new byte value for whatever node it arrived at. The new values were then written out.",

This time I customized Bootstrap's style using Sass, and structured the project to be much more extensible.",

                "When I first created the website, I didn't know anything about web development, and so I directly wrote the html using the Bootstrap library. The downside of this was that the website was a pain to update. After I had created Health At Home with my classmates for my Software Engineering class, I decided to completely remake my personal website in React. I used React's Functional Components to create each aspect of the site in such a way that it is easy to change one aspect of the website without breaking others. I also kept responsiveness in mind as I was re-creating the site, and as a result it also looks really good on mobile!",
                "My favorite part of the website is the way that it seperates out the data from the components. I tried to follow the MVC (Model, View, Controller) layout when designing this website, but was a little unsure about how to follow it exactly, since this site has no backend or database. After looking at some other examples, I started using json files to hold the data for the website, allowing me to update them with raw data and have the website automatically read the json and update itself. This makes things like adding projects, or items to my virtual resume really easy, since I don't need to touch the html/css at all."
